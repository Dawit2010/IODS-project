In this chapter, we have looked at building and validating regression models using R. Specifically, we built a simple linear regression 
model which assumes linear relationship between a target variable of interest and other variables. Thus allowing prediction of the values of the target variable based on information from other variables. 

The data we use for this analysis is [JYTOPKYS3](http://www.helsinki.fi/~kvehkala/JYTmooc/JYTOPKYS3-meta.txt). It is an international survey of approaches to statistical learning. 

- Data wrangling

We first preprocessed the raw data to


- Describe your work and results clearly. 
- Assume the reader has an introductory course level understanding of writing and reading R code as well as statistical methods
- Assume the reader has no previous knowledge of your data or the more advanced methods you are using
