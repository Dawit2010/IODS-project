In chapter 1 of this course, we have looked at the tools we will use for data analysis. These are R - a free statistical programming language widely used for data analysis, Rstudio - an intergrated development environment for R that makes wokring with R easier and streamlined, and github - a version control system that allows systemized archiving of different versions of a project, in this case projects containing data analysis scripts.
